    // Character Type

    // Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type
    // Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.

    let _a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not need to change.
    // For example, if you were using the names of the month in a program,
    // you would probably use an array rather than a vector because you know it will always contain 12 elements

        "October",
        "November",
        "December",
    ];

    // type defination in array
    // i32 is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number 5 indicates the array contains five elements.

    let _a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // same way of writing but in a more concise way

    let _a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];
    let a = [3; 5];

    // Accessing Array Elements through index

    let _first = a[0];

    // Rust protects from invalid memory access through its check mechanism at runtime its a Rustâ€™s memory safety principles in action
    // If the index is greater than or equal to the length, Rust will panic and gives index out of bound error
